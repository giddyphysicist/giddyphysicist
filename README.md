- 👋 Hi, I’m @giddyphysicist
- 👀 I’m interested in modeling and simulation, process automation through python scripting, DeFi and emerging technologies in web3. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about smart contracts and integrating front-end frameworks with web3 and other back-ends for data visualization and building apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solving interesting problems -- if you would like any consulting on web3, process automation, or model & simulation, reach out and see if I can help!
